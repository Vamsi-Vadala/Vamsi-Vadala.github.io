## 🌐 The Problem

Ever tried saving Instagram videos, only to realize there's no easy way to download your **saved posts** or **video links** in bulk?

Sure, you can screen-record... but seriously? We’re in 2025 — if we can simulate an entire Pokémon game in your browser, we can automate Instagram downloads too.

So, I built this **Instagram Downloader Web App** — a combination of Flask, Selenium, ffmpeg, and WebDriver automation that lets you:
- Download a single Instagram video.
- Upload a `.txt` file and download an entire playlist.
- Handle video and audio separately, merge them perfectly.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Breakdown

Here’s how everything fits together:

### 1. `WebdriverDownloader.py`

> Automatically downloads and manages the latest **ChromeDriver** binary.

- Detects your OS (`win64`, `linux64`, `mac-x64`, `mac-arm64`).
- Fetches latest driver version from Google Chrome’s public JSON.
- Cleans up old driver and sets permissions (if needed).

```python
driver_path = downloader.get_driver()
```

This ensures our Selenium browser always works — no “incompatible ChromeDriver” errors!

---

### 2. `loginHandler.py`

> Handles login and cookie management for Instagram.

You manually log in once and it saves the session as cookies using `pickle`. This prevents re-login every time you run the script and also kind of saves you from getting banned. But this is doesn't guarantee anything a feeble attempt to protect you. So a little caution.

```python
pickle.dump(driver.get_cookies(), open("../instagram_cookies.pkl", "wb"))
```

If cookies exist, it reuses them. Simple and smart.

### 3. `InstaDownloader.py`

> This is where the magic happens ✨

The core download logic:
- Launches a **headless browser**.
- Intercepts network logs to find `.mp4` URLs.
- Uses `ffmpeg.probe()` to pick the best quality.
- Downloads audio and video streams.
- Merges them using `ffmpeg-python`.

Also supports:
- Concurrent downloads via `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- Playlist (bulk) download with progress bars using `tqdm`.

```python
self.threaded_download(urls)
self.merge(title)
```

Handles edge cases like:
- Retry if driver crashes.
- Saves failed URLs for retry later.
- Cleans up `.mp3` and `.mp4` fragments post-merge.

---

### 4. `InstaWebDownload.py`

> The Flask app you’ll interact with on your browser.

Two main features:
- Input a single Instagram URL and hit download.
- Upload a `.txt` file of URLs for playlist download.

```python
flash("Download complete!", "success")
```

It flashes success/failure notifications and handles redirects — no page reloads needed.

---

### 5. `index.html`

> A dark-themed UI built with Bootstrap 5 and a touch of futuristic vibes.

- Animated gradient background.
- Clean form inputs.
- Auto-dismissable alerts after 10s.

```html
<form method="post">
  <input type="text" name="url" ...>
  <button type="submit" value="download">Download</button>
</form>
```

It’s simple, aesthetic, and gives a **cyberpunk hacker lab** feel — like you're scraping the Matrix.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

What started as a pain point turned into a full-stack Python project that:
- Uses real-world automation tools.
- Teaches cookie/session management.
- Combines UI, backend, and system-level scripting.
