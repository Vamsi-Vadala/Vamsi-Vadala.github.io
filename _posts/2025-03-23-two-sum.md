## Problem

You can find the problem here --- [Leetcode - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

We need to return the indices of elements that sum up to target. 

---

## My Initial Approach

My first approach is rather... let's just say if I am being nice about my approach, I would use the word *"barbaric"* ðŸ˜‚. Jokes apart, I'll show you the code first and explain what mistakes I made.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            rest = target - nums[i]
            if rest in nums[i+1:]:
                return [i, nums[i+1:].index(rest) + i + 1]
        return None
```

I know right. If you are a seasoned coder your thoughts might be going wild. I just wanted my code to pass all the test cases.

Letâ€™s go through the code â€” so the `for` loop takes \( O(n) \), the `in` keyword check takes \( O(n) \), and slicing creates new arrays which each take \( O(n) \) space. We also used `.index()` which takes another \( O(n) \) in the worst case.

So:
- Time: \( O(n^3) \)
- Space: \( O(n) \)

After a couple of minutes I realized I could just store the current index and use a nested loop instead of the `in` keyword. That would reduce one \( n \) factor in time complexity. Hereâ€™s the slightly more efficient version:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            rem = target - nums[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if rem == nums[j]:
                    return [i, j]
```

- Time: \( O(n^2) \)
- Space: \( O(1) \) â€” No slicing or storage of additional arrays.

---

## Optimal Approach

Now coming to the optimal solution â€” when I saw the follow-up question on LeetCode asking for better than \( O(n^2) \), I thought of using sorting and the two-pointer technique with an additional array. That gives \( O(n \log n) \) time complexity but requires \( O(n) \) space.

If I'm going to use extra space anyway, then it's better to **store already seen values in a HashMap**. If the current valueâ€™s complement (i.e., `target - current value`) is already seen, then return the stored index and the current index.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        sol = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            rem = target - nums[i]
            if rem in sol:
                return [sol[rem], i]
            sol[nums[i]] = i
```

- Time: \( O(n) \)
- Space: \( O(n) \) â€” We use a HashMap to store seen values and their indices.
